# SN-Classification-with-ML

This is my 2018 Summer Research at Carnegie Mellon University with Professor Rachel Mandelbaum and Dr. François Lanusse. 

**Table of Content**

**Programs**

  - No Host Z
     - Filters_Plot_no.py: *Make filter information plot*
     - Plot_018_no.py: *Single plot of light curve data for one SN*
     - Plot_051_no.py: *Single plot of light curve data for one SNIa*
     - FindTypes_no.py: *Find out what types are out there since not all are included in readme; Count how many exist for each type*
     - Make_SN_list_no.py: *Go through the list of SNs and find a certain type of supernova; Then make a table containing a title and a col of all the types*
     - Plot_All_SNIa_no.py: *Make a pdf file containing plots of all the SNIa; Can be adjusted to do it for other type; Ignore data points with negative flux error*
  - With Host Z
     - Filters_Plot_with.py: *Make filter information plot*
     - Plot_105_with.py: *Single plot of light curve data for one SN*
     - FindTypes_with.py: *Find out what types are out there since not all are included in readme; Count how many exist for each type*
     - Make_SN_list_with.py: *Go through the list of SNs and find a certain type of supernova; Then make a table containing a title and a col of all the types*
     - Plot_All_SNIa_with.py: *Make a pdf file containing plots of all the SNIa; Can be adjusted to do it for other types; Ignore data points with negative flux error*
