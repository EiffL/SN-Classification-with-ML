Programs

    No Host Z
      Filters Plot no HostZ.py: Make filter information plot
      Plot_018.py: Single plot of light curve data for one SN
      Plot_051.py: Single plot of light curve data for one SNIa
      FindTypes.py: Find out what types are out there since not all are included in readme; Count how many exist for each type
      Make_SN_list.py: Go through the list of SNs and find a certain type of supernova; Then make a table containing a title         and a col of all the types
      Plot_All_SNIa.py: Make a pdf file containing plots of all the SNIa; Can be adjusted to do it for other types
    With Host Z
      Filters Plot w/ Host Z.py: Make filter information plot
      Plot_105_with.py: Single plot of light curve data for one SN
      FindTypes_with.py: Find out what types are out there since not all are included in readme; Count how many exist for each type
      Make_SN_list_with.py: Go through the list of SNs and find a certain type of supernova; Then make a table containing a title and a col of all the types
      Plot_All_SNIa_with.py: Make a pdf file containing plots of all the SNIa; Can be adjusted to do it for other types
